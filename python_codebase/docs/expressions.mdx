title: Expressions
description: Expressions in Lingua Franca.

A subset of LF syntax is used to write _expressions_, which represent values in the target language. Expressions are used to initialize state variable and to give values to parameters. Arbitrary expressions in the target language can always be given within delimiters `{= ... =}`, but simple forms do not require the delimiters. These simple forms are documented here.

## Basic expressions

The most basic expression forms, which are supported by all target languages, are the following:

- Literals:
  - Numeric literals, e.g. `1`, `-120`, `1.5`, `3.14e10`. Note that the sign, if any, is part of the literal and must not be separated by whitespace.
  - String literals, e.g. `"abcd"`. String literals always use double-quotes, even in languages which support other forms (like Python).
  - Character literals. e.g. `'a'`. Single-quoted literals must be exactly one character long --even in Python.
  - Boolean literals: `true`, `false`, `True`, `False`. The latter two are there for Python.
- Parameter references, which are simple identifiers (e.g. `foo`). Any identifier in expression position must refer to a parameter of the enclosing reactor.
- Time values, e.g. `1 msec` or `10 seconds`. The syntax of time values is `integer time_unit`, where `time_unit` is one of the following:

  - **nsec** or **ns**: nanoseconds
  - **usec** or **us**: microseconds
  - **msec** or **ms**: milliseconds
  - **sec**, **second**, or **s**: seconds
  - **minute** or **min**: 60 seconds
  - **hour**: 60 minutes
  - **day**: 24 hours
  - **week**: 7 days

  Each of these units also support a plural version (e.g., `nsecs`, `minutes`, and `days`), which means the same thing.

  The time value `0` need not be given a unit, but for all other values, the unit is required.

  Time values are compatible with the `time` type.

- Escaped target-language expression, e.g. `{= foo() =}`. This syntax is used to write any expression which does not fall into one of the other forms described here. The contents are not parsed and are used verbatim in the generated file.



For instance, to assign a 2-dimensional list as an initial value to a parameter
in the Python target:

```lf-py
reactor Foo(param({= ((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6)) =})) {
  ...
}
```


## Collections


To avoid the awkwardness of using the code delimiters `{= ... =}`, Lingua Franca supports initialization of simple arrays and similar structures. The interpretation is slightly different in each target language.



In Python, a parameter or state variable may be assigned a list expression as its initial value, as in the following example:

```lf-py
reactor Foo(param = {= [1, 2, 3] =}) {
  state x = {= [1, 2, 3] =}
  ...
}
```

The `param` parameter and `x` state variable become Python lists.
Their elements may be accessed as arrays, for example `self.x[i]`, where `i` is an array index.

The parameter may be overridden with a different list at instantiation:

```lf-py
main reactor {
  f = new Foo(param = {= [3, 4, 5, 6]} )
}
```
