title: Reaction Declarations
description: Reaction declarations in Lingua Franca.

Sometimes, it is inconvenient to mix Lingua Franca code with target code. Rather than _defining_ reactions (i.e., complete with inlined target code), it is also possible to just _declare_ them and provide implementations in a separate file. The syntax of reaction declarations is the same as for reaction definitions, except they have no implementation. Reaction declarations can be thought of as function prototypes.
