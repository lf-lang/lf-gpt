title: Causality Loops
description: Causality loops in Lingua Franca.

## Cycles

The interconnection pattern for a collection of reactors can form a cycle, but some care is required. Consider the following example:

import Py_Cycle from '../assets/code/py/src/Cycle.lf';


This program yields the following diagram:



The diagram highlights a **causality loop** in the program. At each tag, in reactor `B`, the first reaction has to execute before the second if it is enabled, a precedence indicated with the red dashed arrow. But the first can't execute until the reaction of `A` has executed, and that reaction cannot execute until the second reaction `B` has executed. There is no way to satisfy these requirements, so the tools refuse to generated code.

## Cycles with Delays

One way to break the causality loop and get an executable program is to introduce a [logical delay](<../writing-reactors/composing-reactors.mdx#connections-with-logical-delays>) into the loop, as shown below:

import Py_CycleWithDelay from '../assets/code/py/src/CycleWithDelay.lf';




Here, we have used a delay of 0, which results in a delay of one [microstep](../writing-reactors/superdense-time.mdx). We could equally well have specified a positive time value.

## Reaction Order

Frequently, a program will have such cycles, but you don't want a logical delay in the loop. To get a cycle without logical delays, the reactions need to be reordered, as shown below:

import Py_CycleReordered from '../assets/code/py/src/CycleReordered.lf';




There is no longer any causality loop.
